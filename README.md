## Introduction
Amazon Hackon Shopbot is an innovative project that combines the power of Python and Node.js to create a tool that gathers product reviews from Amazon and uses AI to generate marketing content based on these reviews. This tool provides users with a convenient way to leverage customer feedback for product descriptions, use cases, and positive phrases.
