    "description": "\nThe Amazefit GTS2 is a great watch with many features, an affordable price, and a one year warranty. It has a build-in GPS, barometer, and is waterproof up to 5 meters. The watch is also stylish and large enough to actually see. The screen is small, but the display is not so tiny that I could not read anything. The free watch face is useless. A better one costs money, but I am not sure if I can read it either.",
    "Use_cases": "\n\nTop 3 use cases of the product:\n\n1. Phone call and message notifications\n2. Tracking heart rate\n3. Always-on display",
    "phrases": "\n\n-The watch has a build-in GPS, so you can leave your phone at home on your walks, yet still register your route. \n-The analysis of my exercises is great. I see many details I never have seen before with my Fitbits. \n-The screen is very bright and easily readable in full sunshine. The colors are very intense. \n-The watch's battery life seemsgood. Over 3 days I just used 30% of it's battery capacity based on the watch's reporting. \n- According to the documentation the watch is waterproof up to 5 meters, so a thoughtless jump into the pool does not kill the watch."
