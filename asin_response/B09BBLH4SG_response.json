    "Use_cases": ", I'm currently using the 35 millimeter 1.8 which is a great crop lens and I'm getting some absolutely great picture with that and I've heard that the 18 to 55 kit lens is also quite nice it's a great beginner's crop lens to get you started and you can always buy nicer lenses later on, I'm also using the 50 millimeter 1.8 lens which is a great walk-around lens on a crop sensor, it's a nice three-quarters of an inch sensor and it's the sweet spot for lenses, you can get some really good lenses in that size without spending too much money it seems like most of the better lenses come in that size, so anyway if you don't want to spend 5 or 6000",
